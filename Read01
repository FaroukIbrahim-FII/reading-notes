## Learning Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. For example, you can control the display of the document; format words as bold or italic, add images, and creating lists. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in to help view the style of the text the way you want.
Note: Markdown is not a wysiwyg type of text editor.

Following are some of the symbols to use in Markdown:

## Heading:
