## Learning Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. For example, you can control the display of the document; format words as bold or italic, add images, and creating lists. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in to help view the style of the text the way you want.
Note: Markdown is not a wysiwyg type of text editor.
Markdown will help you achieve more while creating your website.

Following are some of the symbols to use in Markdown:


## Heading:

You can use the # symbol to preview a large heading.  
Use two ## for a second lergest heading, and all the way to the ###### to get the smallest header format.


## Styling text:

You can use ** ** to preview a **bold text**.  
Use * * to preview *italic text* 


## Strikethrough:

By using the ~~ ~~ symbol you can make a strike through text.  
for example:  ~~like this one~~.  


## Quoting Code:

To make a Quotation you need to use this symbol >
> type your quote here


## Links:

You can add links to your markdown file by using [] and right the text you want to make a heyperlink to it then followed by () 
Here is one to get to [Google](https://www.google.com/)


## Emojies:

You can show emojies by using : : and adding the emoji code between them.   
Like this :+1: is'nt cool :smiley:


## Task List:

You can even make a check list by using [] with a space between them.  
And you can check it [x].  
I can use it to make a useful list.  
- [x] Make a list
- [ ] Check it.  


## Lists:

You can add ordered lists using 1. 2. 3. ...etc.
You can also use unorded lists using * or - or +
However the unordered lists will appear always like this:
- Create a list
- Keep filling it
