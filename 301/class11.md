# Mongo and Mongoose

1. **SQL** databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.

2. examples:
   * MySql
   * Oracle
   * Sqlite
   * Postgres
   * MS-SQL

3. fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

4. **MongoDB**.

5. *NoSQL* database.

6. *NoSQL* database.

* Structured Query Language.
* A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data.
* tables.
* The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.
* A *NoSQL* database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
* Use collections instead of tables.
* MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections
* MongoDB is more flexible, because it gives you the ability to store your data where ever you want.
* Disadvantages. *NoSQL* databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
