# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

    But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
