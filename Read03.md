# Creating a webpage with HTML

Before rushing our way to discripe what HTML, is we first have to explain what are the steps we have to do to be able to create a webpage.

## Steps for creating a webpage:
1. First and foermost we have to make a Wireframe. so what is a Wireframe, right?
### Wireframe:
Is a hand or digital skitch we use to draw what I want my webpage to look like

2. After I'm happy with my Wireframe ** Now ** I can start with *HTML*.
### HTML:
Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML uses tags to perform the simple tasks and it will shape the structure of the webpage. To get more familiar with it, here is a photo to show you what it looks like.

As you can see we can specify what goes into the *Head* of the page, using <head> tag, and what goes into the body, using <body> tag.

We can do whatever we want to get our page organized the way we want and as per our Wireframe.

3. After completing the structure of my webpage, now it is safe to start prgramming what everything in my page does and in short to bring my page into life using ** Javascript**. You can find more about it by going to the Read04 page, where we discripe what Javascript is and how to use it.

4. Final step is to make the finishing works by adding aesthetics to the page. This is done using **CSS**. We will discripe what it is and how to use in the future.
