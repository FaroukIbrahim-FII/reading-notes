A growth mindset stands for developement of anyone's fundamental abilities through perseverance and effort. In the growth mindset intelligence and talent are seen a good start point and can be used in the developement process. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

1. Challenges
2. Obstacles

1. challenges:

Growth Mindset: Embraces   

2. Obstacles:   
Fixed Mindest: ***Loses focus***   
Growth Mindset: Persists   

3. Effort:   
Fixed Mindset: ***Views as fruitless***   
Growth Mindset: No pain, no gain   

4. Criticism:   
Fixed Mindset: ***Ignores***

Whenever I would remind myself to keep a growth mindset, I simply do the following:
- Value the process over the end result.
- Emphasise growth over speed.
- Redefine “genius.”
